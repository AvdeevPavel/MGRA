\section{Smart Iterators}

This section tells about how to create and use Smart iterators. 

Get iterator by SmartVertexBegin/SmartEdgeBegin methods of EdgeGraph.
Iterate while iterator $!=$ SmartVertexEnd/SmartEdgeEnd.

Smart iterators don't become invalidated after graph operations (addition/deletion). (This is implemented by making iterator graph action listener.)

Comparator can be specified while creating iterator. It should give linear order on the vertices/edges (functor similar to std::less). Iterator will return By default special order is not specified.

To better understand guarantees on the order that smart iterators give, it is useful to understand how it works.
