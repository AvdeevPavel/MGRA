Although this approach proved useful in assembling clones, it faces difficulties in genomic shotgun assembly. We abandon the classical “overlap-layout-consensus” approach in favor of a new euler algorithm that, for the first time, resolves the 20-year-old “repeat problem” in fragment assembly. Our main result is the reduction of the fragment assembly to a variation of the classical Eulerian path problem that allows one to generate accurate solutions of large-scale sequencing problems. euler, in contrast to the celera assembler, does not mask such repeats but uses them instead as a powerful fragment assembly tool.}, number={17}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America}, publisher={National Academy of Sciences}, author={Pevzner, Pavel A and Tang, Haixu and Waterman, Michael S}, year={2001}, pages={9748--9753}}
