\section{Graph action handler}

We widely use concept of listeners to provide consistency of different structures that contain graph info (coverage, paired info, smart iterators). Such structures are bind to graph with corresponding successor of de_bruijn::GraphActionHandler<Graph> (in most of our implementations structure extends this class by itself).

To register listener, use method AddActionHandler of EdgeGraph.

To unbind listener, use method DeleteActionHandler.

Graph is supposed to fire 4 types of low-level and 3 types of high-level events.

	virtual void HandleAdd(VertexId v) {
	}

	virtual void HandleAdd(EdgeId e) {
	}

	virtual void HandleDelete(VertexId v) {
	}

	virtual void HandleDelete(EdgeId e) {
	}

	virtual void HandleMerge(vector<EdgeId> old_edges, EdgeId new_edge) {
	}

	virtual void HandleGlue(EdgeId old_edge, EdgeId new_edge) {
	}

	virtual void HandleSplit(EdgeId old_edge, EdgeId new_edge_1,
			EdgeId new_edge2) {
	}
